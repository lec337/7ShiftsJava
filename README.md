7Shifts StringCalculator exercise,
For each question of the exercise there is a tag
on the repository, for part 1, please use the tag "Part 1 with jar file"
as this contains an easily executable jar file.\
This jar file can be found from the path: 7ShiftsJava/out/artifacts/7ShiftsJava_jar/7ShiftsJava.jar\
Here there is also a file run.bat, since jar files are difficult to run on windows,
if you are using windows, please double click this .bat file to run the jar.\
If on linux or mac, simply use "java -jar 7ShiftsJava.jar" to run the jar file.\
If all else fails, I've added all project files from Intellij to the repository, so 
you should be able to import this project into Intellij and run it without too much trouble.\
The source files can be found under the 7ShiftsJava/src/ directory.\
There is also a design file in the directory 7ShiftsJava/ describing general implementation considerations.
